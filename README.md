Skin Cancer Classification Using Customized CNN

With an estimated annual incidence rate of 2 to 3 million cases worldwide, skin cancer is a major public health concern that affects millions of people each year. The World Health Organization released startling data in 2020: 95,697 fatalities associated with melanoma, the most deadly variety, and an additional 657,903 deaths associated with non-melanoma skin cancer, the most prevalent type. This disease's increasing prevalence emphasizes how urgent it is to address the many problems it brings with it, including the emotional and physical toll it takes on people. The suffering of individuals affected is made worse by the financial load brought on by the expensive nature of treatment and the poor cure rates.
Additionally, skin cancer has social repercussions that go beyond the individual, straining relationships and instilling emotions of insecurity and stigma in families, communities, and households. To reduce the morbidity and death caused by skin cancer, early detection is essential. To improve dermatologists' skills to detect skin cancer early, we suggest a strategy that takes advantage of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. Our joint effort aims to hasten intervention and raise the standard of living for persons dealing with this urgent health issue.
It is significant to note that skin cancer databases frequently experience problems with the quality of the data, such as noise and flaws. Skin cancer occurs in a variety of populations, each with a unique genetic makeup and environmental influences. As a result, these datasets frequently show imbalances in the distribution of the classes, with one group greatly outweighing others. Predictive models may become biased as a result of such class imbalances, thus reducing their accuracy.
We used the MNIST Ham 10000 dataset to build a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in our effort to predict skin cancer. Our model's excellent 99.9% accuracy rate demonstrates the potential for accurate and effective skin cancer prediction using innovative machine-learning techniques.
